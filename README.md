<p align="center">Angular implementation of the famous animation library <a href="https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal">scrollReveal.js</a></p>


### 1. Installation


> bower install --save ngScrollReveal

<br/>

Load scripts:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/scrollreveal/dist/scrollreveal.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/ngScrollReveal/ngScrollReveal.min.js"></script>
```
and remember to add the module as a dependency:
```javascript
angular.module('myModule', ['ngScrollReveal']);
```


### 2. Usage:

Two use cases are provided:

- **Service**: the client is provided of a wrapper of the original library. Inject it in your component and you're ready
to go. you can refer to the [original doc](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal) for the list of available api.

  ```javascript
  angular.module('myModule')
    .controller('myCtrl', function(ScrollReveal){
      ScrollReveal.reveal('.myClass', {duration: 300});

    )}
  })
  ```

- **Directive**: using it as a directive is much more powerful, you simple have to decorate your DOM element with the directive ```ng-scroll-reveal``` passing an object representing the [options](https://github.com/jlmakes/scrollreveal).
In addition the user have the chance to execute a sequence of animation (adding a field 'sequence' to the above object)

  ####A basic usage:
  ```javascript
  options= {
    origin: 'top',
    duration: 300 //ms
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <div id="idTest" ng-scroll-reveal="options">Hello</div>
  ```


  ####Advanced Usage with sequenced animations:

  ```javascript
  optionsSequence = {
    origin: 'top',
    duration: 300,
    sequence: {
      selector: 'myChildSelector', //optional field, if not specified all the DIRECT children will be animated
      interval: 300
    }
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <div ng-scroll-reveal="optionsSequence">
    <div class="myChildSelector">Hello</div>
    <div class="myChildSelector">Hello</div>
    <div class="myChildSelector">Hello</div>
    <div class="myChildSelector">Hello</div>
  </div>
  ```
